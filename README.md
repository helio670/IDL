Plot objects were introduced to IDL several years ago but unfortunately many people still use the old direct graphics methods (e.g., you use the plot procedure rather than the plot function). There are many advantages to plot objects, and this demo covers the basic features.
 
Topics to be covered include:
 
* Making good-quality figures with plot objects for both publications and presentations.
* Plotting images with coordinate information.
* Making time-series plots with objects.
* How to make mp4 movies directly from IDL.
* Some plot object quirks to be careful of.

## Further courses
If you have any other classes you'd like, please let us know.  We are looking for an instructor to give an overview of the new IDL machine learning framework.
